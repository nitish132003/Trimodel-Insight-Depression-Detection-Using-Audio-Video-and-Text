Trimodel Insight: AI-Based Depression Detection Through Audio, Video, and Text Analysis

Abstract
Trimodel Insight is an innovative AI-driven project designed to identify and analyze depression symptoms in individuals by integrating audio, video, and text data. This comprehensive approach leverages advanced machine learning algorithms and neural networks to detect emotional and mental health patterns across multiple modalities. By assessing vocal tone, facial expressions, and textual sentiment, the system provides accurate insights into an individualâ€™s psychological state.

Key Features

Audio Analysis: Utilizes voice modulation and frequency detection to assess stress and emotional patterns.
Video Analysis: Applies facial recognition and emotion detection models to observe microexpressions and mood changes.
Text Analysis: Implements natural language processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate sentiment and detect signs of distress or negativity in written or spoken text transcriptions.
Therapy Recommendations: Based on detected symptoms, the system suggests tailored therapy options, including counseling or self-care practices.
Technologies Used

Machine learning libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
NLP tools: spaCy, NLTK
Audio processing: Librosa, SoundDevice
Video analysis: OpenCV, FER (Facial Emotion Recognition)
Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Objective
To provide a comprehensive solution for early detection of depression and mental health issues by leveraging the power of AI across multiple input modalities, enabling timely intervention and promoting mental well-being.

Impact
This project aims to revolutionize mental health diagnostics by offering an accessible, scalable, and efficient tool for clinicians, therapists, and individuals seeking to monitor mental health effectively.
